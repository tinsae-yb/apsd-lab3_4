<h1> Lab 3 , Part 2 </h1>
<h2> What is Spring? </h2>
 <p>Spring is a java framework for enterprise application.</p> 
<h2>What is Spring Boot? </h2>
  spring Boot is an extension of the Spring framework that simplifies the process of building and deploying Spring-based applications. It provides a set of conventions and auto-configuration capabilities that streamline the setup and configuration of Spring applications, allowing developers to quickly create production-ready applications with minimal configuration.
<h2> What is the relation between Spring platform and Spring Boot? </h2>
 <p> Spring Boot is built on top of the Spring framework. While Spring provides a wide range of functionalities and components for developing Java applications, Spring Boot enhances productivity by simplifying the configuration and setup of Spring applications.</p>
<h2> What is the relation between Spring platform and Spring framework? </h2>
<p>Spring platform refers to the entire ecosystem of projects and tools provided by the Spring organization. This includes the core Spring framework along with various other projects like Spring Boot, Spring Data, Spring Security, etc. The Spring framework, on the other hand, specifically refers to the core module of the Spring platform that provides features such as dependency injection, aspect-oriented programming, and more. In essence, the Spring framework is a fundamental part of the broader Spring platform.</p>
<h2> What is Dependency Injection and how is it done in the Spring platform/framework? </h2>
<p>Dependency Injection is a design pattern used to create loosely coupled components in software applications. In the context of the Spring framework, DI refers to the process of externalizing the dependencies of a class and providing them to the class from an external source, typically through configuration files or annotations.</p>
<h2> What is Inversion of Control (IoC) and how is it related to Spring? </h2>
<p>Inversion of Control is a design principle where the control of object creation and lifecycle management is inverted or delegated to a container or framework. In traditional programming, the application code is responsible for creating and managing objects. In contrast, with IoC, the framework takes control of object instantiation and lifecycle, and the application code focuses on defining the components and their dependencies. Spring implements IoC through its DI container, which manages the creation and wiring of objects based on configuration. So, in the context of Spring, DI and IoC are closely related, with DI being one of the mechanisms used to achieve IoC.</p>
